## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of avocado prices per given region in the United States. The data were obtained from Kaggle. The analysis aims to check which region has a high price of avocados and the number of bags of avocados sold in the years 2015 to 2018.  

The following bullets list the insights I wished to derive:
*	Which year had the maximum number of avocado bags sold?
*	What region had the highest average price of avocado?
*	What region had the lowest average price of avocado?
*	Which avocado type is the most consumed or purchased?
*	How many bags of avocados were sold per region?
  
Here’s what I did:
## Data Acquisition and Preparation
Data was downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was unclean and had 14 columns in total.

## Data Cleaning
I sorted and filtered the data to remove unnecessary and inaccurate data. Then, the data was checked for errors and duplicates. I ensured that there were no blank spaces and no missing data. In addition, some columns with irrelevant field names that did not add any value to the entire dataset were removed to remain with only data that could be analyzed. So, instead of 14 columns, I remained with 10 columns. This was done to ensure that only the best quality data is processed.

## Data Processing
The tool I used to clean the data was Power BI because its tools are easy to work with and it is fast. The raw data were transformed and changed into a standard data format suitable for analysis, storage, and easy use.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
In Power BI, I used Visualizations to create a dashboard as shown in Figure 1. I used a Clustered Column Chart, a Clustered Bar Chart, a Donut Chart, a Line Chart, a Matrix, and Cards. My Charts were assembled and made interactive through the use of Slicers. These Slicers are powerful tools to use if you want to make your dashboard dynamic. In this case, if you are working within a team, it will be easy for you to work collaboratively with your team members. They will be able to add or modify the dashboard to reflect what is expected. 

The figure below shows the dashboard, which was built based on the analysis of the data.

## Data Interpretation
This step allowed me to make sense of my analysis and visualization. The following insights were derived from the analysis and the dashboard.
*	The year 2017 had the maximum number of avocado bags sold (5722) compared to 5615 in 2015 and 5616 in 2016. On the contrary, the total number of avocado bags sold in 2018 considerably decreased to 1296. Both types of avocado (organic and conventional) had a similar total number of bags sold.
*	The two regions having the highest average price of avocado were Hartford, Springfield, and San Francisco, with $1.82 and $1.80, respectively.
*	The region having the lowest average price of avocado was Houston, with $1.05.
*	Although both types of avocado had a similar total number of bags sold, the average price of the organic type was greater than that of the conventional type: $1.65 for organic and $1.16 for conventional.  
*	Based on the data, the total number of avocado bags sold per region was equal to 338 from 2015 to 2018, except in West Texas and New Mexico, which was 335. 
*	From the dashboard, the maximum average price of an avocado is $3.25, and the minimum average price is $0.44.

## Recommendations
The three top recommendations based on my analysis are: 
*	To invest in the avocado business and make more profit, you can go to the Hartford, Springfield, and San Francisco regions.
*	If you are looking for the region that has the lowest average price of avocados or any other fruits, you should go to Houston.
*	Both organic and conventional avocado types have similar bags sold per year. Therefore, it does not matter which type you choose to invest in.
