## Introduction
This projectÂ provides an in-depth review of project performance, budget allocation, and expenses. It analyzes various projects across multiple technology domains, reflecting the organizationâ€™s strategic priorities. 
The interactive dashboard presented here provides meaningful insights and offers recommendations to help the company excel.

## Requirements
The client sought a clear overview of how their budget and expenses were distributed across projects, managers, clients, and days. After cleaning and transforming the dataset in SQL, I designed a single-page interactive dashboard to display all key financial metrics in one place. The data model was built to compare budgeted versus actual spending and to evaluate performance over multiple years.

## Achieved Goals
This report explores the insights gained from data visualization, identifying key trends and areas of focus to inform better decision-making. By analyzing key financial and operational metrics from the data, this report aims to:  
* Identify budget and expense trends.
* Assess project performance.
* Highlight growth and challenges.
* Provide actionable insights.

## Steps to Complete this Project
The following steps were completed:  
* Import the dataset into the SQL Server database to clean it.
* Clean and transform the data to prepare it for analysis.
* Import the cleaned dataset to Power BI to perform the analysis.
* Provide an overall budget analysis from the data.
* Provide an overall expenses analysis from the data.
* Analyze the project performance for each project in the data.
* Build an interactive dashboard to communicate insights from the analysis.
* Provide recommendations for best decision-making.


## Required Tools for this Project 
The following tools were used:  
* Microsoft SQL Server to clean and prepare the data. Use this [link](https://github.com/Songonge/SQL-Projects/blob/main/DataCleaning_TechSolutions.md) to get all the details.
* Power BI to analyze the data and build the dashboard. Use this [link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzgyZWI3ZTctYzk0Ni00Mzg1LWIzNGUtNzA3ODNhZWJiMzlmIiwidCI6IjJhNzA3NDU3LWM0M2QtNDE1Ni05MGViLWVkOTZhNWEzNTRlMCIsImMiOjJ9) to interact with the dashboard live.


## Conclusion
This project highlighted significant trends in budget allocation, expenses, and project performance. While the increasing investment in AI, Cloud Migration, and IoT Automation is promising, the high number of pending and canceled projects suggests areas for 
process optimization. Key takeaways:  
* The data underscores a period of rapid expansion.
* Optimizing project execution and financial management will be crucial for sustaining long-term growth and efficiency.
* Key challenges such as high-pending project volumes, substantial expenses in cloud migration, and a notable number of canceled projects highlight areas requiring strategic intervention.
* To maintain sustainable progress, optimizing project approval processes, improving budget efficiency, and mitigating unnecessary expenditures are essential.  

By addressing these inefficiencies, the organization can ensure sustainable growth and improved project execution for long-term success.
